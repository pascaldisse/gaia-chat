## Core Components

### Persona System
The heart of Gaia is its persona system, allowing creation and management of AI personalities with customizable traits:

```javascript
const persona = new Persona({
  name: "Assistant",
  systemPrompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant",
  model: MODELS.LLAMA3_70B,
  initiative: 7,
  empathy: 8,
  voiceId: "american_female",
  formatSettings: {
    useRoleplayMarkdown: true,
    customFormatting: true,
    formatRules: [
      {
        name: "Speech",
        startTag: "<speech>",
        endTag: "</speech>",
        markdownFormat: "**{{content}}**",
        enabled: true
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

### RPG Mechanics
Unique D20-based system for generating dynamic behaviors:
- 11 distinct attributes (initiative, talkativeness, confidence, curiosity, empathy, etc.)
- Attribute modifiers affecting response style
- Context-aware responses
- Personality-driven interactions

### Voice System
Enhanced text-to-speech capabilities for more immersive experiences:
- Multiple voice engines: Zonos (high quality) and Kokoro (fast)
- Diverse voice options with different accents and genders
- Persona-specific voice settings
- Fixed audio playback sequence bugs to ensure smooth playback
- Enhanced debug UI for voice settings and audio troubleshooting
- Reliable audio chunk processing with improved error handling

### Message Formatting
Custom message formatting system for roleplay and structured outputs:
- Roleplay markdown for actions and speech
- Custom tag-based formatting
- Templated formatting rules for different content types
